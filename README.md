## Simple excersise on React Context API

Simple react app: Context API use, netlify deploy and Contentfull CMS (TODO). Also some basic play with styled-components,react-modal, react-leaflet and form validation using react hooks. 
Based on tutorial by [john-smilga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScDWrogElmo&t=7720s).

[note to myself from the future: see 3 ways of using Context API]
Project was bootstrapped with CRA. 

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Create optimised build assets.
